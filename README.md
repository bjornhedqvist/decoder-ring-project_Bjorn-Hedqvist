# decoder-ring-project_Bjorn-Hedqvist


## Thinkful Engineering Immersion Bootcamp, Module 12: --JS Functions/Algorithms and Mocha + Chai tests -- Capstone project


The goal of this project was to follow a *Test Driven Development* process, and to practice newly learned **Mocha** and **Chai** skills to unit write tests as a way to focus my workflow, in addition to simply testing the code I was building. Using different `expect()` methods in the test files, as well as the foundation of ***JavaScript*** I've aquired over the first three weeks of the program, this capstone creates three functional encoder and decoder algorithms.

My code rests in the `.js` files in the `src` folder, as well as the `.test.js` files in the `test` folder. The rest of the files and folders aside from this `README.md` are property of and credited to Thinkful.

###Thank you for reading and checking out this project, and I look forward to hearing your feedback!
